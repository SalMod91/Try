## Introduction

At Lujain's is a fictional foodtruck passion project of, as the name of the foodtruck suggests, Lujain, wich you can find consistently in the same location during the weekends and at specific events. 

At Lujain's Footruck was born from Lujain's love of cooking and sharing food with everyone, as such it's target is an audience of all ages, especially people down on their luck thanks to the affordable prices wich aim not to make a profit but rather to cover its production costs.

The goal of the website is to help the new audience to find out the concept of the Foodtruck, Lujain herself and why she started this project, what to expect in the Menu , introduce them to the social media page and the biggest reason for visiting the website for new and old users will be to provide informations about the location and events.

## UX

### Site Purpose:

To give the users a way to find information about the location, the menu and the foodtruck itself.

### Site Goal:
To regularly update the users about new locations, events and menu changes.
To bring new user's attention to the social media platforms used to inform the audience about opening times, availability, menu and location.

### Audience:
Everyone who wants to enjoy local, affordable and homecooked food.

### Communication:
The website is structured in a way that once the user lands on it, it won't be overwhelmed by information. With one scroll the user will find a summary of all pages and possible reasons of the visit, structured tightly to not let the eyes wander aimlessly. 

### Current User Goals:
- To see regular updates of the locations, of the events and of the menu.
- To give the user a way to subscribe or get in contact with the owner of the foodtruck.

### New user Goals:
- To navigate the site with ease and clearly understand the information provided.
- To inform new users about the location, events and menu.
- To inform new users about the concept of the foodtruck.
- To introduce new users to the socia media page.

## Design

### Color Scheme:
- Text Color Selection<br>
The decision to utilize black color for the text was carefully considered to ensure optimal readability and visual contrast against the background.
Choosing a high-contrast color combination, such as black text on a light background, is also a recommended practice for improving accessibility. It ensures that users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies can easily perceive and comprehend the text. By prioritizing accessibility in the color selection, the project aims to provide an inclusive experience for all users.

- Header Color Selection <br>
The header serves as a fixed element that accompanies the user's scrolling throughout the website, to emphasize its separation from the main content and to evoke a sense of exclusivity, the "Black Russian" color was chosen. This color provides a stark contrast against the vibrant background.
This design approach ensures that the header remains noticeable and accessible at all times.

- Heading Color Selection <br>
By employing the "Smokeywhite" color for the text on black chalkboards, the design captures the feeling of a relaxed atmosphere associated with handwritten chalkboard menus. It enhances the overall theme of the food truck website, conveying a sense of homemade goodness and approachability to visitors.

- Links and logos <br>
The color #ffb018, which also happens to be the color of the logo, has been carefully chosen to create engaging hover effects for both links and the logo itself. When users hover over links or the logo, the color transitions from the default state to #ffb018 providing visual feedback indicating interactivity.

### Typography:
- Fredericka the Great <br>
The choice of the "Fredericka the Great" font for headings was motivated by the desire to emulate the appearance of chalkboard handwriting. This font's characteristics with its uneven strokes create an authentic and chalk-like texture evoking a sense of informality, capturing the charm associated with chalkboard writings.

- Merriweather <br>
For elements such as headers, footers and events, the "Merriweather" font was selected to establish a more professional and polished tone. This font, compared to other fonts used for the website exudes professionalism and ensures that these important elements of the website are presented in a refined manner.

- Indie Flower <br>
The "Indie Flower" font was used to instill a sense of familiarity and approachability. This was used when trying to create a more intimate and cozy atmosphere, reinforcing the concept of homecooked food and a personal connection with the audience. 

By employing these fonts strategically the design achieves a balance between the playful and professional atmosphere.

### Imagery:
The selection of images for the website involved a combination of royalty-free images and a few notable exceptions that warrant special mention:

- Hero Image <br>
The hero image mainly features a food truck wich was sourced from a royalty-free image provider. While the image captures the essence of a food truck it is important to note that the selection was limited by the availability of royalty-free options. As a result, the chosen image might not fully align with the exact vision or specific details of the project. Despite the limitations the food truck image serves as a visual representation of a mobile kitchen and the idea of serving delicious homecooked food on the go.

- Black Hero Image/Chalkboard frame <br>
A black frame was skillfully created by VFX artist and good friend Tony Manzi. The decision to use a black frame was driven by the desire to establish a strong contrast with the background wich features a light-colored wooden cutting board. The black frame effectively creates a visually striking separation that draws the viewer's attention.

- Logo <br>
The logo for the foodtruck featuring a loaf of bread has also been skillfully designed by Tony Manzi. The choice of a loaf of bread aligns with the concept of the foodtruck offering sandwiches.

- Menu Pictures <br>
Due to the specific theme of sandwiches on a cutting board with a black background it was challenging to find royalty-free pictures. With my life partner's and owner of the fictional foodtruck, Lujain's suggestion i explored Canvas AI wich was able to generate menu pictures that met my specific requirements.

## Features 

### Navigation Bar:

  - Featured on all  pages, the navigation bar ensures that the users always know their current location and have easy acces to different sections of the site by following the user's scrolling.
  
  - The key design principle of the navigation bar is to provide clear visual cues regarding the user's location with the website by highlighting the location through the use of an underline (inspired by Love Running project).
  
  - To enhance the interactivity of the navigation bar, hovering over the links triggers a color change effect. When users hover over the logo and navigation links, the color changes to #ffb018, providing visual feedback.

  - The navigation bar is designed to adapt to different screen sizes. It utilizes two "nav" elements, each with its own visibility based on the width of the viewport. Above a width threshold of 1025px wich is typical on larger screens such as desktop and laptops, the primary navigation bar is displayed.
![Primary Navigation Bar](/assets/images/readme-images/navbar.webp)

- Below a threshold of 1024px, tipycal on smaller screens such as mobile devices the navigation bar transforms into a hamburger icon, indicating the presence of a sliding menu. <br>
  The idea for this, especially the use of gradient coloring for the hamburger icon has been inspired by https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/ wich i later customized to adapt to the specific requirements and aesthetics of my website.
![Secondary Navigation Bar](/assets/images/readme-images/navbar-2.webp)

### Landing page:

  - The landing page includes a photograph of a foodtruck as the hero image. This enables visitors to quickly recognize and relate to a food truck website.

  - To ensure a user-friendly experience, the landing page includes four distinct, for a lack of a better definition, "summary boxes" that represent each a section of the website: menu, location & events, concept & story and contact. These boxes help the user find what they are looking for without overwhelming them with information. Each summary box is accompanied by an intuitive and interactive button. When users hover over these button the color scheme transforms providing visual feedback and highlighting an interactive object.
  ![Summary Boxes](/assets/images/readme-images/summary-box.webp)

  - The landing page has been designed with intuitive navigation in mind. It can be scrolled through with a single scroll (on a desktop/laptop size screen) and only one click is necessary to reach the goal of the visit. By minimizing the effort required to find information i prioritize a user-friendly and convenient environment. 

### Chalkboard:
  - Upon entering any page outside the landing page the users are welcomed by a black chalkboard stating the location of website. This consistency reinforces the sense of location of the user. Combined with the fixed header and the underlined active page it ensures the user never feels lost on this website.
  The font "Fredericka the Great" has been used to mimic the chalk like handwritten aspect familiar with chalkboards. 
  ![Chalkboard](/assets/images/readme-images/chalkboard-welcome.webp)
### Menu page:

  - The users landing on the menu page are specifically interested in food so i allowed the page to be longer in order to be able to present each item with its description of the ingredients and an image. This way the user can make a detailed and informed choice.
