## Introduction

At Lujain's is a fictional foodtruck passion project of, as the name of the foodtruck suggests, Lujain, wich you can find consistently in the same location during the weekends and at specific events. 

At Lujain's Footruck was born from Lujain's love of cooking and sharing food with everyone, as such it's target is an audience of all ages, especially people down on their luck thanks to the affordable prices wich aim not to make a profit but rather to cover its production costs.

The goal of the website is to help the new audience to find out the concept of the Foodtruck, Lujain herself and why she started this project, what to expect in the Menu , introduce them to the social media page and the biggest reason for visiting the website for new and old users will be to provide informations about the location and events. <br> The website is live and can be found [HERE](https://salmod91.github.io/project-1-at-lujain/index.html)

## UX

### Site Purpose:

To give the users a way to find information about the location, the menu and the foodtruck itself.

### Site Goal:
To regularly update the users about new locations, events and menu changes.
To bring new user's attention to the social media platforms used to inform the audience about opening times, availability, menu and location.

### Audience:
Everyone who wants to enjoy local, affordable and homecooked food.

### Communication:
The website is structured in a way that once the user lands on it, it won't be overwhelmed by information. With one scroll the user will find a summary of all pages and possible reasons of the visit, structured tightly to not let the eyes wander aimlessly. 

### Current User Goals:
- To see regular updates of the locations, of the events and of the menu.
- To give the user a way to subscribe or get in contact with the owner of the foodtruck.

### New user Goals:
- To navigate the site with ease and clearly understand the information provided.
- To inform new users about the location, events and menu.
- To inform new users about the concept of the foodtruck.
- To introduce new users to the socia media page.

## Design

### Color Scheme:
- Text Color Selection<br>
The decision to utilize black color for the text was carefully considered to ensure optimal readability and visual contrast against the background.
Choosing a high-contrast color combination, such as black text on a light background, is also a recommended practice for improving accessibility. It ensures that users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies can easily perceive and comprehend the text. By prioritizing accessibility in the color selection, the project aims to provide an inclusive experience for all users.

- Header Color Selection <br>
The header serves as a fixed element that accompanies the user's scrolling throughout the website, to emphasize its separation from the main content and to evoke a sense of exclusivity, the "Black Russian" color was chosen. This color provides a stark contrast against the vibrant background.
This design approach ensures that the header remains noticeable and accessible at all times.

- Heading Color Selection <br>
By employing the "Smokeywhite" color for the text on black chalkboards, the design captures the feeling of a relaxed atmosphere associated with handwritten chalkboard menus. It enhances the overall theme of the food truck website, conveying a sense of homemade goodness and approachability to visitors.

- Links and logos <br>
The color #ffb018, which also happens to be the color of the logo, has been carefully chosen to create engaging hover effects for both links and the logo itself. When users hover over links or the logo, the color transitions from the default state to #ffb018 providing visual feedback indicating interactivity and confirming an action to the user.

![Colour Palette](/assets/images/readme-images/colour-palette.webp)

### Typography:
- Fredericka the Great <br>
The choice of the "Fredericka the Great" font for headings was motivated by the desire to emulate the appearance of chalkboard handwriting. This font's characteristics with its uneven strokes create an authentic and chalk-like texture evoking a sense of informality, capturing the charm associated with chalkboard writings.

- Merriweather <br>
For elements such as headers, footers and events, the "Merriweather" font was selected to establish a more professional and polished tone. This font, compared to other fonts used for the website exudes professionalism and ensures that these important elements of the website are presented in a refined manner.

- Indie Flower <br>
The "Indie Flower" font was used to instill a sense of familiarity and approachability. This was used when trying to create a more intimate and cozy atmosphere, reinforcing the concept of homecooked food and a personal connection with the audience. 

By employing these fonts strategically the design achieves a balance between the friendly and professional atmosphere.

### Imagery:
The selection of images for the website involved a combination of royalty-free images and a few notable exceptions that warrant special mention:

- Hero Image <br>
The hero image mainly features a food truck wich was sourced from a royalty-free image provider. While the image captures the essence of a food truck it is important to note that the selection was limited by the availability of royalty-free options. As a result, the chosen image might not fully align with the exact vision or specific details of the project. Despite the limitations the food truck image serves as a visual representation of a mobile kitchen and the idea of serving delicious homecooked food on the go.

- Black Hero Image/Chalkboard frame <br>
A black frame was skillfully created by VFX artist and good friend Tony Manzi. The decision to use a black frame was driven by the desire to establish a strong contrast with the background wich features a light-colored wooden cutting board. The black frame effectively creates a visually striking separation that draws the viewer's attention.

- Logo <br>
The logo for the foodtruck featuring a loaf of bread has also been skillfully designed by Tony Manzi. The choice of a loaf of bread aligns with the concept of the foodtruck offering sandwiches.

- Menu Pictures <br>
Due to the specific theme of sandwiches on a cutting board with a black background it was challenging to find royalty-free pictures. With my life partner's and owner of the fictional foodtruck, Lujain's suggestion i explored Canvas AI wich was able to generate menu pictures that met my specific requirements.

## Features 

### Navigation Bar:

  - Featured on all  pages, the navigation bar ensures that the users always know their current location and have easy acces to different sections of the site by following the user's scrolling.
  
  - The key design principle of the navigation bar is to provide clear visual cues regarding the user's location with the website by highlighting the location through the use of an underline (inspired by Love Running project).
  
  - To enhance the interactivity of the navigation bar, hovering over the links triggers a color change effect. When users hover over the logo and navigation links, the color changes to #ffb018, providing visual feedback.

  - The logo hover function has been created by positioning 2 logos on top of each other. The coloured version with a higher z-index value was positioned above the white logo while setting it's opacity to 0%. Once hovered the opacity changes to a value visible to the user creating a visual feedback and a sense of interactivity.

  - The navigation bar is designed to adapt to different screen sizes. It utilizes two "nav" elements, each with its own visibility based on the width of the viewport. Above a width threshold of 1025px wich is typical on larger screens such as desktop and laptops, the primary navigation bar is displayed.
![Primary Navigation Bar](/assets/images/readme-images/navbar.webp)

- Below a threshold of 1024px, tipycal on smaller screens such as mobile devices the navigation bar transforms into a hamburger icon, indicating the presence of a sliding menu. <br>
  The idea for this, especially the use of gradient coloring for the hamburger icon has been inspired by https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/ wich i later customized to adapt to the specific requirements and aesthetics of my website.
![Secondary Navigation Bar](/assets/images/readme-images/navbar-2.webp)

### Landing page:

  - The landing page includes a photograph of a foodtruck as the hero image. This enables visitors to quickly recognize and relate to a food truck website.

  - To ensure a user-friendly experience, the landing page includes four distinct, for a lack of a better definition, "summary boxes" that represent each a section of the website: menu, location & events, concept & story and contact. These boxes help the user find what they are looking for without overwhelming them with information. Each summary box is accompanied by an intuitive and interactive button. When users hover over these button the color scheme transforms providing visual feedback and highlighting an interactive object.
  ![Summary Boxes](/assets/images/readme-images/summary-box.webp)

  - The landing page has been designed with intuitive navigation in mind. It can be scrolled through with a single scroll (on a desktop/laptop size screen) and only one click is necessary to reach the goal of the visit. By minimizing the effort required to find information i prioritize a user-friendly and convenient environment. 

### Chalkboard:
  - Upon entering any page outside the landing page the users are welcomed by a black chalkboard stating the location of website. This consistency reinforces the sense of location of the user. Combined with the fixed header and the underlined active page it ensures the user never feels lost on this website.
  The font "Fredericka the Great" has been used to mimic the chalk like handwritten aspect familiar with chalkboards. 
  ![Chalkboard](/assets/images/readme-images/chalkboard-welcome.webp)

### Menu page:

  - The users landing on the menu page are specifically interested in food so i allowed the page to be longer in order to be able to present each item with its description of the ingredients and an image. This way the user can make a detailed and informed choice.
  ![Menu Item](/assets/images/readme-images/menu-item.webp)

### Location and Events page:

  - The location and events page is designed to provide users with essential information about the food truck's whereabouts and upcoming events. The page is divided into two distinct sections.  
  
  - The upper part of the page is dedicated to providing users with detailed information about the food truck's location through an embedded Google Map and a description next to it. The interactive map enables the users to visualize the area and convienently plan their visit.
  ![Location Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/location-preview.webp)

  - The lower part of the page in a separated section users can find informations about the upcoming events wich will be regularly updated. 
  ![Events Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/events-preview.webp)

### Concept and Story page:

  - The concept and story page serves as a platform to immerse users in the unique vision and values behind the food truck. This page is divided into three distinctive sections, providing information about the concept, eco-friendly practices and the story that led to the creation of the foodtruck.

  - The first section of the page introduces users to the core concept. Through a combination of images and descriptions i aim to convey the essence of the concept of the food truck: every dish is lovingly prepare in a home-cooked style. In some instances certain images have been chosen for my own personal amusement and do not depict the exact content in a literal sense (see the gnome in the snow representing "small and fresh" and the happy loaf of bread). 
  ![Concept Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/concept-preview.webp)

  - In a standalone section i placed some special emphasis on the commitment to eco-friendly practices. Here users are informed that the owner prioritizes the use of eco-friendly materials wich aligns harmonously with the overall concept of the food truck.
  ![Eco-Friendly Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/eco-friendly-preview.webp)

  - The final section of the page delves into the inspiring story behind the creation of the food truck. An image of the owner herself and the narrative enables the users to connect with the passion and dedication behind every aspect of the food truck: the unwavering will (i was waiting forever for an excuse to use this line) of delivering exceptional homemade food infused with love. 
  ![Story Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/story-preview.webp)

### Contact page:

  - The contact page server as a direct way of communication between the users and the owner. This way the users can recognize that their opinion and suggestions are valued while being rewarded for their activity with updates and informations.

  - The first section of the contact page features a contact form where users can easily get in touch to share their suggestions and feedback. By filling out the contact form a "form-dump" page opens thanking them for getting in contact. 
  ![Contact Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/contact-preview.webp)

  - The second section of the contact page features a subscribe form wich offers the opportunity of staying informed about any updates, changes to the menu, location and events. By filling out the subscribe form a "form-dump" page opens thanking them for subscribing.
  ![Subscribe Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/subscribe-preview.webp)

  - Upon submission of either form, users will be redirected to a corresponding form-dump page to confirm their submission.
  ![Form-Dump 1 preview](/assets/images/readme-images/form-dump-1-preview.webp)
  ![Fomt-Dump 2 preview](/assets/images/readme-images/form-dump-2-preview.webp)

### Footer:

  - The footer section follows the same concept as the header, creating a distinctive and consistent visual experience separating it from the rest of the website. It includes a smaller version of the logo, contact information and relevant social links. 

  - To keep consistency with the header and the rest of the website the social links also feature an interactive design in order to promote a visual feedback to the user. The social links open the associated social platform in a new tab.

  - As with the header also the footer's design is consistent in all pages giving the user a sense of familiarity when navigating the website.
![Footer Preview](/assets/images/readme-images/footer-preview.webp)

### Future Features:

- Multiple scrolling images in the landing page.
- A gallery.
- An error page with a "return to the homepage" button.
- Scrolling reviews in the landing page

### Lighthouse: 
- The page has a good rating in Lighthouse, ultimately i couldn't manage to improve the performance due to my lack of experience with images. <br> The same is true for the "Best Practices" score lacking a correct image aspect ratio in order to receive a full score![Lighthouse](/assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse.webp)

### Unfixed Bugs

- Header Logo: <br>
The transparent colored header logo has been manually filled with the color #ffb018 using a paint program. However, due to this manual process, the filling might not be perfect, resulting in a slight white border around the text. While this border is visible to the naked eye or when zoomed in, it is a minor imperfection. <br>
Note: It is worth mentioning that for the header logo, relying on the assistance of Tony Manzi to achieve a perfect fill was not pursued, as he had already contributed significantly to the project without any expectation of reciprocity.

- Footer: <br>
On the landing page, when viewed at full screen, the footer is not perfectly centered. To address this issue, a simple solution is to apply the CSS rule "width: 33%" to the flex-row-container, which will ensure proper alignment and centering of the footer.

## Thought Process

### Initial Thoughts 
In this section, I will provide an informal account of my thought process during the initial stages of the project. While the following description may deviate slightly from formal conventions, it aims to convey honesty and authenticity in capturing my genuine experience. <br> 
Embarking into this project marked my first independent endeavor in coding so i approached it with an exploratory mindset wich is just a fancy way of saying: "I improvised alot without actually knowing what i was doing" <br> Initially i drew inspiration from the Love Running project as a "template" to bounce off ideas using what was taught to start shaping the landing page. Short thereafter i found that my design idea started diverging from it very quickly. At that point i was on my own embracing a trial-and-error approach experimenting different techniques wich led to a landing page created inefficiently often requiring the use of position:relative/absolute, along with careful adjustments of margins and paddings. <br> I found this not very efficient and time consuming recognizing the need for a greater efficiency. 

### First writing 
While sorting throgh the notes i took during the web development course to look for an alternative i stumbled upon the flex positioning wich felt to me like a ray of light amidst the darkness.
My first breakthrough came with the realization that I could use a container element and apply the flex attribute to it. Thinking i had discovered a hidden gem my ego was soon struck down when realizing some time later after a google search that the flexbox positioning (it even has a name for how common it is) was a well-known and used technique.
I started applying flexbox positioning to the subsequent pages although i didn't fully grasp its potential until the last pages of the website where i altogether stopped using position:relative/absolute to help me position the elements. <br> Seeking to improve my knowledge about the flex positioning i ran into the following guide: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/. <br > I found myself on more occasions going back to improve upon the old code thanks to this "cheatsheet" although i kept some of the less efficient one as a reminder for myself of the progress i feel i made. <br> W3schools was also used to inform myself about the possible CSS rules i could apply to it like the notable example of ":nth child" selector wich i to reverse the rows of the concept&story page.

### Editor 
The first frustration came in the form of the editor. At the time Code Anywhere was having major server issues wich resulted in significant work delays of approximately a week. Uploading images became problematic and the editor suffered from significant lag. I switched over "temporarily" to Gipod when CA failed to upload some images, wich can be found as one of the early commit messages. Eventually i decided to finish the project on Gitpod.

### Images 
The background image posed one of  my first challenges wich in hindsight now sound silly. After an extensive search i finally managed to find an image suitable for the background but its life size was too large. Compressing it reduced the quality of the image drastically wich was visually unappealing. I solved this by compressing it myself through cutting and resizing using the standard microsoft photo viewer. <br> The hero image's chalkboard has also been "photoshopped" by me using an advanced, barely known program called "Paint".
Another challenge I faced was the time-consuming task of sorting through royalty-free images to find suitable visuals for various sections of the website. I received valuable assistance from my partner, Lujain, who dedicated a significant amount of time to help me search for appropriate images that aligned with the overall concept of the project.

### Mentor Support 
Initially i believed i could get by on my own but after completing the first sketch of the landing page and menu page i decided to give the mentor support a try. This turned out to be one of the best decisions i made through the project. I was fortunate to receive guidance from my mentor, Lauren, whose assistance proved invaluable. Lauren introduced me to various extensions and tools, emphasized the importance of the conventional commit messages. Introduced the advantages of using Chrome over Firefox and provided tips and best practices that i could have not fathomed on my own. <br> Lauren was supportive and motivating, readily available even outside the Mentor meeting times. Her guidance played a significant role towards the progress i made during the project. Lauren's mentorship undoubtedly elevated the quality of my work.

### Header 
From the get go, I planned a dynamic header with an animated logo and a collapsible navigation bar that would transform into a hamburger icon on smaller screens. The idea of animating the logo through the use of transforming the opacity from 0 to 100% came naturally to me. Initially the logo stood alone but i felt it could add more information. Later i edited the PNG that my friend, Tony Manzi, created for me by adding the text "@ Lujain's" to give a sense of branding. One of the main challenges was when the time to create the hamburger icon and sliding menu came up. At that point i gathered enough experience to come up with an input checkbox prompting the visibility of the menu but i struggled to create the actual hamburger icon. Eventually i came across a helpful YouTube video that taught me how to use three <span> elements to represent the bars of the hamburger icon. I quickly realized that the flaw in it was that only the bars themselves were interactive and clicking or tapping between the bars would create no effect. I had to scrap the hamburger icon and start from 0 again. After an extensive online search (it is difficult to find a way to create a hamburger menu without javascrypt apparently) i found a website introducing the idea of creating a label, similar with the spans, but using color gradient attribute to shape it. Using that concept i finally created my hamburger icon after different attempts. This website also introduced me to the possibility of using 2 nav bars, wich i thought of but scrapped the idea assuming that it wasn't syntactically correct. There was also an overlay idea to show a dark background when the hidden menu appears wich was an intriguing idea. I ultimately decided not to implement it since that wasn't my idea, i felt uncomfortable applying to this project something taken from someone else, it would lessen the appreciation i have for my work and it wouldn't be a representation of what i created.

### Internal Link Buttons 
I initially utilized and styled the "button" element as a descendant to the "a" element, to stand out and communicate to the user that it is an interactable object that will reward you for using it by applying the #ffb018 color and black text color reversed when hovered on. To my surprise all my love put into it has been almost wasted because i later through the validator that it is not correct to have a "button" being a descendant of an anchor. After mourning my fallen comrade, the "button", i decided that if i cant have a button i will have the anchor looking like it! This way i fixed the issue and it works as intended. <br> Note to "a": although you may look like my old friend "button" i wont love you the same way!!

### Footer 
The footer was first created through a mix of flex positing and absolute/relative positioning. However i wanted to further explore the possibilities of flex positioning and decided to use it as a learnin experience and experimented with the concept of flex-grow. While the footer content isn't perfectly centered with the rest of the website, i chose to leave it as is. This decision was taken because i risked falling into the trap of the comfort zone of using what i was comfortable with instead of exploring and improving. So kept it as it is, a mangled positioning mess to remind me that i still have a long way forward. <br> It's important to note that if this project were to be used profesionally i would have easily being able to center it by applying the CSS rule "width: 33%" to the flex-row-container and switching it to "width:auto" at media query max-width:740px (tested).

### Media Queries 
The implementation of the media queries were challenging at first due to my initial improvised approach without an end game plan. I had to rewrite the majority of the code again by using the old foundation and make it more efficient for the transition to smaller screens. Once the foundation was changed from manual positioning to a more stable flex positioning resizing it became easy. I struggled in the beginning because first and foremost of a lack of experience, and also because the containers and images were bigger than 1440px causing some issues with Chrome. I switced to Firefox once more wich later caused me some more trouble. Firefox didn't accurately display when elements like container were out of frame. For instance, i mistakenly resized containers and images to 768px for screens down to 769px, forgetting to account for additional space occupied by paddings and borders. Only after commiting the changes and testing them on http://responsivetesttool.com/ did i find out about this issue. Subsequently switching back to Chrome and changing the old postioning code to flex positioning the developing of media queries got easier. 

### Validator 
After separating me from my friend "button" i hesitantly had to rely on the Validator again. I used spans in wrong places ignoring the fact that spans are inline elements and that they cannot contain block elements and the validator made me aware of it. I fixed this by changing the spans to divs and called it a day. 

### General Design
Every element has been meticoulously chosen to fit the aspect and concept of the main idea. Consistency was the core element behind every decision. 
Every container enjoys a 30px margin at full screen gradually resized to 10px on smaller screens. Initially i used percentages to determine the size of margins and paddings wich i later changed to px values after the flex breakthrough and after some insights from my mentor. <br> All pages have the consistency of using the same concept: a white transparent background to separate the content from the body background, from ca. 60% to ca. 80% of the screen size depending on the content displayed. Initially i considered positioning the pages in the navbar based on the container size but later concluded that the priority in the list of orders of the navbar should be the importance of the visit. The most likely reason to visit should probably be menu and location wich have different sizes of containers. I had to settle. <br>

Side note: I must admit that while I enjoyed the coding aspect of the project, I struggled with the visual design elements. It often led to procrastination and frustration. I loved writing code but i hated trying to imagine wich position would fit best and what would look nice. Fortunately i have my partner Lujain to thank for if i even remotely made progress. She is a talented painter, although she wont admit it, and enjoyed helping me in the beginning when i was lost and demotivated for the 100th time. 

### Wire Frames

Initially, having had prior experience as a restaurant ownr, I had a cler vision of what i wanted with the website and how it would look up to the Menu Page. <br> I used paint to create a mockup for myself being oblivious to the fact it should be added to the README file so now you get to enjoy my art.
